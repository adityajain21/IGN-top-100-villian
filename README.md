# IGN Top 100 Villians :hocho:

Simple scripts written in both PHP and Python to scrape the data from [IGN Website](http://ca.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/) to scrape a list of Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time :hocho: (because villians are way more cool than heroes) and save in a MySQL database.
Then display it in a list one-page format which was not present on IGN original website.

I basically built this scraper so that I could read about all the villians on a single page and I don't need to click on NEXT for every other villian (Yeah, I am lazy :sleepy:).
