# IGN Top 100 Villians

This is a simple script written in PHP to scrape the data from [IGN Website](http://ca.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/) using HTML DOM Parsing and hence display the data in a list format which was not present on IGN original website.

I basically built this scraper so that I could read about all the villians on a single page and I don't need to click on NEXT for every other villian.
