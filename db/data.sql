(1, 1, 'Magneto', 'Like many characters of his era, Magneto did not immediately stand out as someone who would endure the test of time. His powers were relatively unimpressive, his motivations and depth were weak and his costume designâ€¦ let''s face it - the guy wears a bucket on his head. But the archenemy of Charles Xavier has proven over the decades that he''s not only worthy of his infamous status, but worthy of a much greater accolade - being the greatest villain ever created. The Master of Magnetism doesn''t just operate well along stereotypical bad guy parameters, but can actually sustain engaging, masterful storylines of his own. \nAs a Jewish child in Germany during the height of Adolf Hitler''s reign, Max Eisenhardt discovered humanity was capable of the worst crimes and actions. What''s remarkable is despite seeing genocide first hand and enduring the terror of concentration camps, Max has matured into exactly what took his family and loved ones from him. To protect his kind from the fate of a similar Holocaust, Eisenhardt persecutes any and all humans who dare cross his path. \nMagneto has become bigger than his peers and virtually all of his enemies. It''s the sign of a great character when his presence dominates a story and his absence creates a vacuum that cannot be filled by any other. Through his legendary role in Marvel Comics over the years as well as fantastic portrayals in film and animation, it''s hard to argue that there has ever been a villain more complex, nuanced, sympathetic and yet irrevocably evil.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/923/923207/marvel_magneto_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(2, 2, 'Joker', 'There was never any doubt in our minds the enigmatic, psychopathic Clown Prince of Crime would yield the top spot amongst DC Comics'' villains. The Joker is the definition of a scene-stealing, deliciously wicked character, one that is quite possibly more interesting than his superhero counterpart. \nA year ago we argued Joker wasn''t necessarily Batman''s greatest enemy, a fact which would clearly make his high rank here a bit of a mystery. Over the past year, however, three high profile projects reminded us why this character is absolutely one of the best ever created and developed throughout the history of superhero comic books. The Dark Knight, Joker and Batman R.I.P. are not only three of the greatest Batman stories ever created, but perfect examples of why the Joker is the quintessential comic book villain. He exists because of his enemy, and without creatures like the Joker, there would be no Batman. More importantly, this villain is capable of reinventing himself in various iterations, whether it''s the savage, sadistic one in R.I.P., the chaos agent in Knight or even the light-hearted comedian from the animated series some 15 years ago. \nA great villain isn''t just capable of wicked deeds or murder. Depth and layer matter. Heroes and villains are inextricably linked, and just as the sign of a great hero is a great villain, the opposite is true. The Joker must stand up to and alongside the Caped Crusader. This is one of the rare villains to possibly do even more than that. As his movie role last summer proved, he can even surpass one of the greatest heroes of all time. That takes a special something.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/923/923882/dc_joker_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(3, 3, 'Doctor Doom', 'Victor Von Doom is, above all odds, a star in his own right. We don''t know about the rest of you, but we consider him to be the fifth member of the Fantastic Four - a member of the series so integral that when he''s not involved, we''re decidedly less interested. \nDoom boasts neither powers nor inherent abilities - a rarity for any being in his genre of comic books. Victim of a troubled past, Victor''s mother was taken from him early in life. Seemingly since that time, Doom has sought to prove himself to his peers. Chief among those is Reed Richards, the one man who has proved equal and better to Victor''s astonishing intellect. Doom''s irrational obsession and animosity towards Mr. Fantastic and his family might be his only fault, the one obstacle keeping his from truly achieving his larger desires - the conquest of all his surveys. The Latverian monarch''s ambition might be kept in check by the Fantastic Four and their friends, but if anything, his lust for power grows every day, becoming more and more brazen. \nIf his depth, characterization and legacy in the Marvel Universe weren''t enough, Doom has one other accomplishment that few in the industry have managed - he''s one of the inspirations for one of the most infamous characters in pop culture - Darth Vader.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924268/doctor-doom_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(4, 4, 'Lex Luthor', 'Superman is arguably the greatest superhero ever created. He is the personification of all that is good in our world, the one beacon of light when all else is dark. He is the one hero that cannot falter in the face of evil. \nSuch an entity of peace and justice needs an equivalent response. In Lex Luthor, the Man of Steel has that perfect match, and best of all, Luthor isn''t just a simple creature of darkness (hello, Doomsday!). What makes Lex such a fantastic character becomes evident when you look at the world from his point of view. He''s not necessarily trying to rule the world; in his eyes he''s saving it. Think about that for a second - Luthor is trying to save the world from the unwieldy, crushing rule of an alien from Krypton. This man craves to be the world''s savior, yearns to have "his" people worship the ground he walks on and refuses to see that birthright seized by another. \nLike many villains on our roster, Luthor is a man physically outmatched by his foe. Rather he must conjure up ways to outsmart his opponent, relying on his resources to attempt to reshape the world to his satisfaction. One can only wonder what the world would be like if Lex actually applied his knowledge to making the world a truly better place rather than obsessing over one man. Would he be the great savior he claims to be? The mere fact that we ask that question is a sign of a well-written, deeply layered villain.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/921/921082/lex-luthor_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(5, 5, 'Galactus', 'Death. Eternity. The origins of the universe. These concepts and beings are fundamental to the existence of the Marvel Universe. Equal to these, however, is the next member of our Top Villains list - Galactus. Despite his rather garish appearance, the being formerly known as Galan lived before the birth of the modern cosmos, and is as fundamentally important to it as entities responsible for the creation and elimination of life. Galactus, in his destruction of planets, brings balance to the universe, just as life is given and taken every day on Earth. \nIt''s this larger than life presence which makes Galactus one of the more important villains ever created, but it''s his ties to Earth and its heroes that make him one of the greats. Through the creation of his heralds, destruction of the Skrull Empire and attempts to devour the Earth, this being is one of the greatest threats ever known to our beloved heroes. Most other villains pale in comparison. \nLastly, though it seems like something small, we can''t overlook it. Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer. He''s compelled to destroy worlds because of one simple fact - he''s hungry. Can''t blame a guy for wanting a little snackâ€¦ can you?', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924247/galactus_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(6, 6, 'Darkseid', 'The DC Universe is packed with powerful entities that could destroy worlds at a time, but none are as feared or brilliantly executed as Darkseid, Lord of the war planet Apokolips. The evil god has had quite a legacy crafted for himself since being created by Jack Kirby. Not too shabby for a character that first appeared in a Jimmy Olsen book, eh? \nDarkseid''s motivations are rather simple - conquer and control all life by unlocking and solving the Anti-Life Equation, something DC fans saw him achieve in last summer''s Final Crisis event. Though the storyline technically took the New God''s life, it''s hard to imagine the heroes of DC won''t find themselves face to face with the ultimate embodiment of evil at some point down the road. \nPerhaps the most appealing trait of Darkseid is his lack of interest in direct, physical confrontation. The being formerly known as Prince Uxas has immense strength, endurance and eye beams that can disintegrate, teleport or torture opponents, yet he chooses to manipulate events from the shadows, allowing his minions to act on his behalf. Darkseid''s involvement with the New Gods, including his rivalry with the Highfather, the planet New Genesis and the diplomatic exchanges of sons Orion and Mister Miracle add multiple layers to a being that might otherwise be yet another generic worldwide threat. We''re certainly glad DC wouldn''t allow Kirby to kill off this fantastic villain as he originally planned. Decades of spectacular tales would have been left on the table otherwise.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924015/darkseid-picture-160boxart_160w.jpg'),
(7, 7, 'Ra''s Al Ghul', 'You''d expect an immortal, international terrorist to want many things, but perfecting the Earth isn''t one of them. And yet that''s been Ra''s Al Ghul''s goal during his many lifetimes. He tears down societies to have them rebuilt in a more ideal fashion, bent on crafting his version of a utopia. "The Demon''s Head" has spent centuries slaving away at this vision, and even he has lost track of his exact age. Fueled by the life-giving Lazarus Pits, which have the side effect of driving a person mad, Ra''s will likely haunt the DC Universe for centuries to come. \nThough Ra''s has taken on the entire Justice League of America in the past - and beaten them - his principle opponent throughout his decades of tales has been Batman. Ra''s considers the Dark Knight to be his only worthy opponent, and in an ironic twist is actually the grandfather of Bruce Wayne''s son, Damien. Best of all is that the Demon Head''s ultimate goal, the betterment of the world, is one that speaks to Batman and strikes a bit close to home. \nRa''s Al Ghul is easily one of the most unique villains ever crafted. By taking a desire that all of us have and warping it, he is truly a character we love to hate.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/923/923925/ras-al-ghul_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(8, 8, 'Loki', 'The God of Mischief has been around far longer than Marvel Comics, but we can''t help but love the incarnation that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby conjured up several decades ago. Since that time, Thor''s half-brother has become a pivotal character in comic books, and is actually the villain that caused the creation of the Avengers. If that isn''t an important event, we''re not sure what is. \nImportant moments aside, Loki is a character that writers must simply love to write as he''s been involved in some fantastic stories, the current run of Thor just being the latest of those. His hatred and jealousy of Thor runs so deep that Loki will stop at nothing, including the corruption and destruction of Asgard itself. Loki has even recently inhabited the body of Sif in order to deny the God of Thunder his love. \nLoki has never been more important than he is now. As a member of Norman Osborn''s villainous cabal, the Asgardian god is now in a position of influence, one that he is exploiting in numerous ways. Osborn''s own agreement with Loki is to return Asgard to the heavens. An alliance with fellow Cabal member Victor Von Doom is yielding new control over Asgard. Manipulation of a sect of Avengers is even proving useful as a way to keep Osborn''s personal interests under watch and influence. \nThere are many master manipulators, but this god has proven he has no equal. Marvel''s Dark Reign may prove in the end to be the reign of one wicked Norse god.', 'http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/object/920/920001/loki-2_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(9, 9, 'Dark Phoenix', 'Quite honestly, the combined efforts of a half dozen villains on this list aren''t likely to surpass what the Dark Phoenix accomplished in a brief moment. While most evildoers scheme and contemplate the destruction of the world, the Phoenix Force, through Jean Grey and in its most savage state, has simply acted and destroyed billions of lives. \nAs one of the most powerful entities on this list, the Dark Phoenix has immense telepathy and telekinetic abilities, but more importantly control over matter itself. This power level, combined with the classic nature of the original "Phoenix Saga" storyline, has largely prevented Marvel from revisiting the concept, despite teasing it in a limited capacity on numerous occasions through Jean Grey''s resurrection or various mini-series that explored the nature of the Phoenix Force itself. \nDespite having limited exposure when compared to many of the other villains in the upper ranks of our list, the Dark Phoenix is still one of the most accomplished and legendary. To this day, the Phoenix Saga is regarded as one of the best X-Men stories ever created. That accomplishment alone was a huge factor in our rankings.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/919/919717/jean-grey_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(10, 10, 'Kingpin', 'Wilson Fisk has no powers. He has no immense global influence when compared to some of his rivals on this list. He barely ranks as a blip on the radar of some of the most powerful heroes. But the Kingpin of Crime is in many ways indicative of what makes Marvel characters so appealing. He''s grounded. He''s realistic. Most of all, in some ways, you can understand what made this man and what drives him to this day. \nFisk grew up poor and picked on. He never seemed the type to rise through the ranks of any organization let along the criminal underworld. Yet rise he did, eventually lording over New York City with an iron fist, using assassins like Elektra and Bullseye with ruthless efficiency. Over the years Fisk has attempted to back out of his dark role in the world, but is continuously dragged back. He''s lost multiple families due to his connections and poor dealings over the years, and these tragic events only seek to remind readers that underneath his muscular exterior is the heart of a man who might have been good were it not for the brutal events in his life. \nAnd now, despite first appearing in a Spider-Man comic book, Fisk is the darkness to Daredevil''s light. In fact if he''s not somehow involved in Matt Murdock''s life or superhero antics, we feel like something is missing from his series. You''ll see us say it again later on, but that''s the truest sign of a brilliant villain, one that has benefited from years and years of excellent storytelling.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/923/923975/the-kingpin_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(11, 11, 'Catwoman', 'Yet another villain that has stood the test of time as a mirror to the Dark Knight, Catwoman has a bit of a unique angle when compared to her rivals. Outside of Talia Al Ghul, Selina Kyle is likely the closest thing to love that Bruce Wayne has ever experienced. In fact Kyle is one of the few distinguished characters to know Wayne is in fact Batman. \nThat connection alone is enough to propel Catwoman high up on our list, but it''s also worth recognizing her fantastic, layered characterization. In fact her conduct over the years has allowed her to straddle the line of hero and villain, and in recent years she''s been more of an anti-hero of sorts, despite constantly breaking the law and defying authorities. (She makes the list because of her decades of villainy mixed with DC''s dedication to keeping her just on the darker side of the morality line.) \nIt''s her willingness to play any side to her advantage that makes Catwoman such a compelling character. She serves herself and no other cause or master. She''ll clash with Batman if she''s executing her latest heist, but isn''t afraid to exact her revenge on Hush, stealing his great wealth and leaving a vicious enemy of Batman with nothing but whatever is in his pockets. Her unpredictable nature combined with her unwillingness to play within the rules (which she could easily do given her many superhero contacts and pseudo-allies), makes her certainly one of the most entertaining baddies in the business and one of the strongest female leads in the industry.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924239/catwoman_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(12, 12, 'Two-Face', 'In many ways The Dark Knight articulated and demonstrated the importance of Harvey Dent better than we ever could. Dent is, in so many ways, the biggest failure of Batman''s career, and is a constant reminder of the price that can be paid in the battle against evil. Two-Face is a character that has been best served by time, evolving throughout the years from a relatively simple gimmick (similar to many of Batman''s foes) to one of the most layered, tragic figures in superhero fiction. \nDespite having a dark past, Dent rose through the ranks of Gotham to be a respected District Attorney, working with Jim Gordon and the Caped Crusader to wage a war on crime. Dent falls to a plot organized by the criminals he had been breaking down, and thus was born a new crime figure, one who can''t distinguish between right and wrong without the help of his lucky coin. \nLike many on this list, Two-Face isn''t always a criminal. Several storylines have healed Dent''s madness, and scarring, only to have him pulled back into the darkness. These struggles between "Dent" and "Two-Face" only serve to demonstrate the loss Gotham has suffered. The first major victory of organized crime may have been the only one it ever needed. Without Dent consistently on the side of light, Gotham might not stand a chance - Batman or not.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924177/two-face_comic_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(13, 13, 'Norman Osborn', 'Even before Dark Reign, the Green Goblin had been terrorizing the lives of Spider-Man and many Marvel superheroes. Though he originally died after slaying Gwen Stacy in one of the most infamous Spidey stories of all time, Osborn returned in the late ''90s and was revealed to be an instigator in many dark moments of Peter Parker''s life, including the "death" of Aunt May. Osborn''s corruption has even reached his son, Harry, who is one of Parker''s best friends. \nThough Osborn was once merely a great foe in his Green Goblin guise, he''s evolved beyond that. With the end of Secret Invasion, Norman has seized control of many United States resources, including what''s left of Tony Stark''s SHIELD and Avengers teams. And unlike many of his wicked peers, Osborn has done this without the use of his Green Goblin persona. What''s fascinating about this turn of events, and what has drastically added to the appeal of this character, is that Osborn''s power depends on his ability to keep his sanity together, something that appears more and more unlikely as time goes on. By giving in and letting the Goblin take over, Osborn might fail in retaining the power he has craved for so long. \nOne thing is for sure - Osborn''s star is on the rise. By the time Dark Reign is finished evolving, we might be ready to reconsider where this foe deserves to be placed on our list.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924136/green-goblin_alex-ross_posterboxart_160w.jpg'),
(14, 14, 'Red Skull', 'There are two big components to what makes the Red Skull such a classic villain as far as we''re concerned - and one of them just happened a couple years ago. First thing is first - the Skull is a Nazi and, just like in gaming, it''s tough to find a better villainous group outside of zombies and perhaps vampires. It''s a simple way to categorize and create a villain, but it''s effective, particularly set in opposition to Captain America. Toss in an incredible visual and you have a character that is arguably the greatest fictional Nazi ever. \nThe second point is absolutely the most important. When you think about it, arch nemeses rarely succeed. The Joker never killed Batman. Lex Luthor has yet to beat Superman. But the Skull managed to outwit and outplay Cap, and in the end, he watched from afar as his master plan came to fruition. Steve Rogers was assassinated and the Marvel Universe lost its only true beacon of hope. \nThe Skull might seem a clichÃ© figure now, but he was one of the original uses of villainous Nazis in comic books. Combine that with his successful track record and great design and you have one legendary character.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924044/red-skull_marvel_picboxart_160w.jpg'),
(15, 15, 'Sinestro', 'This is one villain whose clout has really risen in the past couple years. Originally one of the greatest Green Lanterns, Sinestro has always had a dark side and a overwhelming lust for power and control. After his actions were discovered by his masters, he was exiled for punishment. Unfortunately the Guardians only managed to embolden their former student, and he became their greatest nemesis. \nDespite being sentenced to death on several occasions and even suffering a broken neck at the hands of Hal Jordan''s Parallax entity, Sinestro has always found a way to crawl back to the surface. With the creation of his own Corps, Sinestro now has power to rival the Guardians, and is a constant threat to the order of the universe. What was once a rather simplistic character has evolved into a true force of evil and in some ways might be compared to an intergalactic Adolf Hitler. \nSinestro''s interference in the affairs of DC''s heroes is about to reach critical mass. Though he is currently on his home planet of Korugar, the Black Lanterns are coming. Sinestro is unlikely to care about the plight of innocents, making his role in the Blackest Night event unpredictable and, in all likelihood, bad for the Guardians and remaining members of the Green Lantern Corps.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924236/sinestro_dc_pic2boxart_160w.jpg'),
(16, 16, 'Black Adam', 'Teth-Adam is yet another major DC villain that has skyrocketed in popularity, power and complexity in recent years. Though the character has been around for over 60 years, it''s only been through the efforts of Geoff Johns, David Goyer and other modern writers that he''s deserved a place on our list. \nIn modern storylines, Adam is a magically powered citizen of Kahndaq, one who brutally removes a dictator from power and seizes control of his country. Adam''s dedication to his home and family is what has helped redefine the character, making him someone who does reprehensible things but within strict moral boundaries. Over time Adam''s family grew, and his wife, Isis, began to reform a man many consider to be an anti-hero. Sadly rivaling interests sought to crush Kahndaq''s influence in the world. These actions led to the death of Isis and her brother, Osiris. Adam, in his rage, managed to single-handedly instigate a third World War, clashing with many of the world''s heroes. \nDespite these actions, Adam will stand up for the greater good when it serves his interests. During the Final Crisis, Teth stood up to Darkseid''s forces, nearly dying in the process. Despite his vicious instincts, Adam''s people still worship him, as he is one of the few who have stood up for them. Even some of the greatest villains have benevolent interests and causes at heart, and few exemplify this better than Black Adam.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924093/black-adam_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(17, 17, 'Brainiac', 'To be quite honest, the Man of Steel doesn''t have the best gallery of rogues. Superman might be a legendary hero but his villainsâ€¦ not so much. But through its repeated appearances over the decades culminating in one incredible, history-altering storyline last year, one particular city-collecting cyborg has become one of our all-time favorites. \nBrainiac has had multiple incarnations over the years, some consistent and some diverging radically from previous stories. Geoff Johns streamlined all of that last year, putting forth the idea that every iteration in fact originated from one master that had never been seen by fans. This original Brainiac''s purpose was to capture cities and assimilate knowledge in order to gain power. Part of its operating procedure was to destroy planets and galaxies in its wake to prevent that knowledge from spreading. \nAs part of this reimagining, Johns also revealed that General Zod was a fierce defender of Krypton when Brainiac arrived to acquire the city of Kandor, adding layers to a character that prior to Johns'' involvement was a stereotypical megalomaniac. Beyond his implications for other villains and his legacy within Superman''s rogues, Brainiac''s most important traits are these - it has a very personal connection to Kal-El and can directly challenge him both physically and mentally. There are very few that have that distinction, allowing Brainiac to rank up there with the best of them.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924060/brainiac-update_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(18, 18, 'Mystique', 'Not every great villain has to be a world-conquering, war-mongering, super-powered bad ass. Some of them are simply great at manipulating events to their liking, bending the world to their desire and getting away with it. Mystique is one of those villains, and is absolutely one of the greatest female villains ever created. \nRaven Darkholme''s history is a bit convoluted, particularly as she relates to the complex X-Men history, but that''s not necessarily what makes her important. The key points would be these - she is the mother of Sabretooth''s son, the mother of Nightcrawler and a foster mom for Rogue. Her history with these various characters has given her a prominent seat in the future of the mutant race, and she even played a critical role (despite being revealed as a traitor) in the 2006 storyline Messiah Complex, which kicked off a major new era in the history of the X-Men franchise. \nDue to her age (which is estimated at over a century), Raven has played a role on many teams, involving herself in many causes including the X-Men, Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, X-Factor, Marauders and more. Most recently she was involved in clashes with Wolverine (who sought revenge for her betrayal in Messiah Complex) and Iceman, where she apparently died. Given the number of times she''s allegedly been killed, it''s hard to imagine this espionage master will remain missing in action for long. \nIn essence, over the years X-fans have been treated to a kick ass femme fatale who has found herself at several key turning points in the history of the mutant race. Oh, and you have to love her design, both in film and print. ''Nuff Said.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/920/920173/mystique_comics_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(19, 19, 'Juggernaut', 'Cain Marko is a relatively straight-forward villain, but an iconic and important one nonetheless. Though his recent history has been filled with a failed attempt to be heroic, most IGN readers - and the editors at IGN for that matter - see him as a classic X-Men foe. \nMarko served in the Korean War alongside his step-brother, Charles Xavier. When the two ran across an enchanted cave, Marko managed to acquire the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak and became the Juggernaut. Years later, Marko would arrive at the doors of Xavier''s mansion, seeking revenge. Over the years the Juggernaut''s history was developed to portray the villain in a more sympathetic light. He wasn''t simply evil - he had a dark childhood and hated his step-brother for the advantages he perceived Xavier had. \nThroughout his career, Juggernaut has clashed with the X-Men, Hulk, Thor and, in some ways most notably, Spider-Man in a classic two-part arc. His motivations might be a bit simple, but it''s hard to argue against the character''s popularity, design and impact on the X-Men and their founder.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924199/juggernaut_marvel_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(20, 20, 'Bullseye', 'Bullseye has never been about subtlety, nuance or emotion. He''s a killer, through and through, with a disputed history that may or may not be true given some stories being narrated by Bullseye himself. The only clear information fans have at this point is that the man''s first name is Lester. The restâ€¦ it''s hard to say. Did he have an abusive father and a mother who was a prostitute - and did he kill them? Did he have a brother? Was he a baseball player and involved in ops where he ran across Frank Castle? Nothing is entirely clear. \nEnigmatic characters are often hits with readers, and Bullseye is no exception. Through his involvement with the Kingpin, Bullseye gained notoriety, killing Elektra in an infamous and brutal scene. The assassin quickly became one of Daredevil''s archenemies, and has even returned in recent years to kill another one of Matt Murdock''s lovers, Karen Page. Bullseye has moved away from Daredevil''s corner of the world in recent years, most notably becoming part of Norman Osborn''s grand plans, first as a part of the Thunderbolts and later as a member of the Dark Avengers. \nEven more remarkable is that Bullseye has no superpowers. That''s noteworthy as the hit man confronts his powerful opponents physically and often in close quarters. Though his marksmanship borders on being power-based, Marvel has never provided an explanation for his abilities. Regardless, his ties to the Kingpin, major moments in Daredevil history and current high profile storyline make this one successful assassin.

The fact that he himself, and perhaps many reading this, would argue he''s not even a villain in the first place makes him all the more fascinating. The Smartest Man in the World, Adrian Veidt felt that the normal kind of physical super heroics he''d engaged in for years were not enough to truly change the world. No, he plotted to do something much grander. \nThe fact that this grand plan involved killing millions of people is of course what makes him such a chilling character. From his perspective, what he did - faking an alien attack in New York that killed all in the path of its psychic shockwave - was the ultimate example of doing something for the greater good. Veidt felt that this kind of horrific attack from a perceived outside threat was the only thing that could unite a world on the brink of nuclear war. And notably, Veidt appeared to be correct, and would argue that this act of forced sacrifice stopped billions more from dying in the long run. \nBrilliant and able to deal with almost every curve ball thrown his way, Veidt succeeds in his plan at the end of Watchmen, only explaining the details to Rorschach and Nite-Owl after he''s sure it''s gone off without a hitch.

Spider-Man''s dark, violent and murderous counterpart, Venom came to be when Eddie Brock, a reporter with a vendetta against Spider-Man, found the alien symbiote costume Spider-Man had picked up during Secret Wars, only to discard it when he discovered its true nature. \nWith his hulking physique and monstrous, alien like mouth (complete with fangs and a drooling tongue), Venom, who has all of Peter Parker''s powers, is like a distorted and scary funhouse mirror version of the black costumed Spider-Man, and his knowledge of Peter''s secret identity allowed him to target his enemy in particularly cruel and dangerous ways. \nVenom''s popularity right out of the gate was huge - he was easily the most talked about new Spider-Man villain in years, which went hand in hand with the sensation caused by the evocative work of the incredibly buzzed about young artist who first drew Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man, Todd MacFarlane. The character was so popular that he suffered from over-exposure for a time, popping up so often in Spider-Man books and various mini-series that his impact was diluted. That over-exposure thankfully eventually stopped, and what remains is still one of the most notable and iconic Spider-Man villains ever. \nEddie Brock has gone through many changes and identity shifts through the years, and the Venom persona has not always been his. But while Eddie himself has gone back and forth between fighting for what he perceives to be right -- the "Lethal Protector" -- and outright villainy, it''s inevitable that he eventually succumbs to his dark side, and fans are treated to another Spider-Man Vs.

The robot Pym first created could initially be called a success, since it did indeed achieve intelligent and sentience -- to a very dangerous degree, causing it to strike out at its creator and set out to become one of the Avengers greatest threats. \nFrom his early days posing as the Crimson Cowl and leading one of the many incarnations of the Masters of Evil, Ultron has proved to be cruel, clever and resourceful. Constantly upgrading himself, his frequent name changes (Ultron 5, Ultron 6, etc.) predicted the modern era ''Version 2.0'' idea of the ever-improving and streamlined piece of technology, here represented in the scariest way possible. The early upgrade that turned his entire metal body into adamantium only increased Ultron''s strength and made it more difficult to stop him. \nThe Avengers have found that they can only temporarily stop Ultron. Able to exist within computers and other technology, Ultron always comes back; more difficult to defeat than the last time. His lack of humanity and disrespect for life makes him all the more intimidating -- Ultron is the kind of foe who can rarely be reasoned with and trying to find his sympathetic or compassionate side is a fool''s errand (Ultron 12 aside). \nUltron''s cold view of humans led to one of his most brutal and despicable acts, as he slaughtered an entire Eastern European country, Slorenia, showing no mercy and certainly no regret over his actions. More recently, Ultron''s threat has become a cosmic one, as he took to the stars and led the Phalanx quest for conquest.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924154/ultron_marvel_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

Shortly after his debut, Apocalypse would transform Warren Worthington from Angel to Archangel, forever altering that character''s path - something Apocalypse would do several times again in the future with other notable characters. \nHis other recruits, both volunteers and those he forced to do his bidding, have included Wolverine, Hulk, Caliban and Sunfire, all of whom served as one of his Horsemen at one point or another. Meanwhile, his ever more elaborate back-story revealed he was born thousands of years ago, in Ancient Egypt, and in fact was the oldest and earlier Mutant on earth, having survived encounters long in the past with everyone from Kang the Conqueror (in his Rama-Tut guise) to Dracula himself. \nApocalypse is also responsible for an 19th century scientist becoming another major X-Men threat, Mr. Sinister, and it was Apocalypse''s actions that led to Scott Summers'' baby son being infected with the techno-organic virus - thus beginning Nathan''s path towards becoming the futuristic hero Cable, who would go on to be one of Apocalypse''s greatest foes.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/923/923976/apocalypse_marvel_picture2boxart_160w.jpg'),

Very quickly, Spider-Man learned that the heavyset man with poor eyesight was not to be underestimated, and in a memorable moment, Dr. Octopus grabbed Spider-Man with his mechanical limbs and effortlessly subdued the young superhero - and then slapped him hard in the face with his very human hand. Tossing Spider-Man aside (and out a window) like he was absolutely nothing to him, Dr. Octopus instantly had a physical and mental impact on his foe and this encounter led to Spider-Man''s first real occasion of self-doubt and fear, so shaken was Peter Parker by this encounter with a villain who truly was his match. \nAlong with Green Goblin and Venom, Doctor Octopus has secured his place as one of Spider-Man''s greatest and most dangerous foes. From organizing the Sinister Six, to causing the death of George Stacy, to his vicious (and nearly fatal) assault on Black Cat, Doctor Octopus has a long legacy in Spider-Man stories, which Peter Parker would like to forget. Though how can he forget the man who very nearly married his Aunt May?! \nWhether his plans involve his brilliant knowledge of science or his desire to become a gang leader, "Doc Ock" has proven to be remarkably versatile in his talents, which has been bad news for Spider-Man over and over again.

Later, we''d learn of Sinister''s obsession with Scott Summers and the Summers genetic line, which led to him creating a clone of Jean Grey - Madelyne Pryor - with the sole purpose of breeding with Scott. The result of that successful quest led to the birth of Nathan Summers, AKA Cable. \nHaving survived seeming death multiple times, Sinister has most recently been reborn in a female body, Miss Sinister.

He intends to use Custer in his own scheme to overthrow the leadership of the Grail. \nStarr''s countenance is marred by a series of scars around his right eye that form star shape - they were put there by bullies in his youth whom he has long since dispatched with. He is a skilled marksman, despite not having sight in one eye, but is not especially adept at unarmed combat - his justification for this is that he has "no intention of being unarmed." \nThrough a bizarre string of punishment that is meted out to Starr, a running gag in the series, the character becomes even more disfigured. He loses a leg after being attacked by three hillbillies, he has his right ear shot off, and Jesse cuts a penis-shaped gash in his forehead. Oh, and to add insult to injury a Rottweiler bites off his genitals. After each humiliating incident, Starr merely utters a glib, "S***."

When his wife Nora fell seriously ill, he discovered a way to cryogenically freeze her body until a cure could be found. \nFries'' colleague attempted to stop the process, and the ensuing struggle doused Fries with hazardous chemicals. These chemicals induced strange physical changes in his body: his skin grew pale, he could only survive in sub-zero temperatures and his mind became fractured. Fries created a containment suit that served to protect his body and augment his strength, as well as a gun capable of flash-freezing anything in its sights. \nWith his wife gone and his grip on humanity shattered, the newly dubbed Mr. Freeze began terrorizing the citizens of Gotham City. His gun became a way of inflicting on others the pain he feels in his own heart. Though his crimes typically serve little purpose, Mr. Freeze is still coldly ruthless and one of Batman''s most deadly foes. \nPathos is a key ingredient in any great villain, and Freeze has tons of it. This man dedicated his life''s work to curing his cryogenically-frozen wife''s cancer, and just happened to fall victim to one of those unfortunate accidents that seems to always befall comic book characters. Who can''t relate to that? \nMore importantly, Victor Fries'' loss is as deep as Bruce Wayne''s, which makes him such a dynamic antagonist. To up the stakes even further, the comics have progressed Mr. Freeze into a truly deranged lunatic, one who has given up all hope of reviving his dead wife and accepted a career of unadulterated murder.

Lucifer''s adventures on Earth following his exit from Hell are methodical and patient, poetic in their simplicity and always underlined with a sense of menace. \nPart of Lucifer''s appeal as a villain is that he doesn''t brow beat readers over the head with his villainy. His intellect is matched by his ability to manipulate creation into what he imagines. Any being that can marshal demons to battle angels and still find time to stir humanity from indifference is a threat no one can ignore. Yet somehow, Lucifer''s ability to stay below the radar and simultaneously impact mankind is both a gift and a curse. \nBeing mostly confined to the Sandman universe has not stopped this character from making an impact, but it has prevented Lucifer Morningstar from making the epic one he deserves.

Heiress to a vast fortune, Minerva was selfish and raised by her parents'' servants. Throughout her childhood she grew to be very neurotic. At seventeen her parents were killed in a car accident, which permanently disabled Ann as well. She decided to visit Africa to search for the powers of the cheetah to heal herself. Ingesting a combination of human blood and berries of the plant-god Urzkartaga, she became Cheetah, but not without a catch. The Cheetah host was supposed to be a virgin, and Minerva wasn''t.

However the storyline was so powerful it directly influenced the excellent X2: X-Men United. The film took the general framework from that graphic novel - in which Stryker kidnaps Professor X and attempts to use him to unwittingly help set off a machine that can kill all mutants on Earth. The film revised Stryker to be a corrupt United States Army General. \nThanks to X2''s hype and success, Stryker has played a major part in modern X-Men comics, where he''s proved to be just as dedicated to his cause as ever, targeting every last mutant on Earth as his "holy crusade" continues.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/142/14240065/william-stryker_comics_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

Long before he had his incredible powers, he was a no good thug. During a stint in prison, Marko''s girlfriend, Marcy Conroy, left him for another member of gang.

He attacked Sue Storm and Reed Richards at their wedding of all places. He blew up cars with children in them, tried to take over New York''s power supply and was even hired by J. Jonah Jameson to beat up Spider-Man on TV.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924040/electro_marvel_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(88, 88, 'Hunter Rose', 'One has to admire Grendel''s tenacity. For being such a minor player and number 88 on our list, his ego is bigger than most. Case in point: Hunter Rose came to Gotham City to looking for crime, but mostly wanting to challenge Batman to a match of wits - just to see if he could. \nA corrupt youth named Eddie turned assassin Hunter Rose, Grendel operates best when pushing the limits of what he can and cannot do. Which makes his challenge to Batman even more fitting, given how arguably similar they are. \nHunter is a man of culture and learning, much like Bruce Wayne, who doesn''t hesitate to strike down those who oppose him - much like Batman. But unlike Batman, Grendel is a debonair monster, a murderer who wears a mask because it''s easier to exact justice when no one can see who their executioner really is. That power, the choice to use it in such away, combined with his electric fork (think a utility belt in the form of a twin-bladed spear) make Grendel a welcome addition to the list. If only he would get more play opposite Batman, and in the mainstream in general.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/142/14276095/hunter-rose_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(89, 89, 'Shade', 'There aren''t very many people who can rock a top hat and not come off looking like a complete idiot. In fact, unless you''re Fred Astaire, Slash, or Johnny Depp, we would absolutely advise against it. Just don''t tell The Shade, one of DC Comics'' oldest supervillains, that we bagged on his headwear of choice.\nThe Shade, created by E.E. Hibbard and first appearing in Flash Comics #33, was introduced as a thief with the power to manipulate shadows using a magical cane. He is notable for battling two generations of superheroes -- crossing paths with the original Flash, and later with the Barry Allen incarnation.\nThe character was significantly retooled after Zero Hour, into a morally ambiguous Victorian-era immortal by the name of Richard Swift who acquired his ability to manipulate shadows and his immortality from an unexplained mystical accident. The unexplained catastrophe killed over a 100 people, but left Swift with only a loss of all memory before the event. In the aftermath, Swift was caught up in a scheme by members of the criminal Ludlow family who tried to kill him. It was then that Swift''s deadly shadows were first unleashed.\nWhile his feud with surviving members of the Ludlow family continued, Swift settled in Opal City, where he worked as a paid assassin. He relocated for a time to Keystone City where he first encountered the Flash (Jay Garrick), toying with him under the guise of a gimmicky villain as a smokescreen for his truly important crimes.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/143/14321325/shade_dc-comics_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(90, 90, 'Carnage', 'Also known as Cletus Kasady, Carnage was born killing. As a child he pushed his grandmother down the stairs, tortured his dog and burnt down his orphanage. After getting put in prison for being oh, a serial killer, his cellmate ends up being a one Eddie Brock (Venom). Brock''s Venom symbiote has a baby, since they can produce asexually and all, and bonds with Kasady through a cut. Kasady becomes Carnage, Carnage escapes and then the real fun begins.\nThe Carnage symbiote ends up being stronger than Spider-Man and Venom combined. He can shape-shift, create weapons like knives and axes with its web substance and plant ideas in people''s heads. He can crawl like Spider-Man, regenerate and is immune to infection and disease. This comes in handy since Kasady, without the symbiote, has a form of cancer. He feeds on his victims by just touching them and can see from any part of his body. Carnage even at one point develops immunity to the sonic booms symbiotes usually are vulnerable to. For every murder, Kasady writes "Carnage Rules" on the walls with his own blood.\nCarnage is so powerful that Spider-Man has to make a truce with his arch nemesis Venom just to fight him. Even when Venom re-absorbs his child''s symbiote, Kasady just can''t stop killing. He paints himself red and goes to town as a regular human murderer. Carnage even has a psychological streak, believing that everybody wants to kill, he just has the guts to do it. He doesn''t want money or power, he just likes killing. First introduced in Amazing Spider-Man #344 Carnage was modeled after The Joker to be a darker version of Venom.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924217/marvel_carnage_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

He  launched the first attack on the Mundy world with his army of wooden soldiers. The Adversary''s forces are under his total control as they roll across the homelands conquering everything in their path. \n What is The Adversary''s true identity? Those unfamiliar with Fables might be surprised to learn that he is none other than Geppetto -- yes, from the tale of Pinocchio. But he''s no longer a kind old woodcarver.  His mind twisted, Geppetto is now the ruthless, magic-wielding ruler of an Empire seeking complete conquest of Fablekind. \n The Adversary is rarely glimpsed in the comic, but he is the driving force behind the entire narrative. By overtaking the characters'' homelands, he forces them out into the "real" mundane world where they migrate to New York and go underground.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/143/14338098/the-adversary_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),
(92, 92, 'Parallax', 'Nevermind that he looks like a really pissed off cockroach, this sentient organism made of fear is responsible for turning one of DC''s most beloved heroes into an intergalactic mass murderer. \n The original storyline to position Green Lantern Hal Jordan as a villain was so controversial (in a good way), that it was repurposed by writer Geoff Johns as means to re-invent Jordan''s brief but bloody reign as Parallax. \n Originally designed as a creature to be more monster than symbiotic threat, the thing evolved into a major player, especially in the events making up the Sinestro Corp''s offensive. The evil fear monger''s new license on life has continued to engage fans by contributing consistently satisfying drama to the epic universe that belongs to the Green Lantern Corps.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/924/924229/parallax_dc-comics_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

Omni-Man, the former premier superhero-turned-villain in Image Comics'' Invincible universe, is notable not only for his superhuman abilities (strength, speed, and invulnerability), but also for his sweet moustache. Moustaches, as it turns out, are customary among males of the Viltrumite race, an alien civilization from when Omni-Man (AKA Nolan Grayson) comes. \n Arriving on Earth under the guise of helping our planet, Omni-Man took on the secret identity of a best-selling author named Nolan Grayson. He married a woman whose life he had saved, and had a son, Mark Grayson -- Mark would become Invincible, the series'' protagonist. \n Father and son came to cataclysmic blows when Omni-Man revealed his true intentions to his son -- he was sent as a conqueror by the Viltrumite Empire. Omni-Man flees when he realizes he is unable to kill his son, and takes refuge on another planet. \n As a result of his failure on Earth, Omni-Man is captured by his own people and sentenced to death. But he is rescued just before execution by former foe Allen the Alien, to whom he reveals that the Viltrumite race is actually near extinction. The pair then set out on a crusade to destroy the Viltrumite Empire, moustaches and all.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/143/14338225/omni-man_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

Generations later, one of the spores evolved into an insect-like creature, which somehow was extremely intelligent and found a knowledge transference helmet to get even smarter. Thus is the story behind Annihilus. This same old story again? \n Since he came from humble beginnings being a seed spore and all, Annihilus turned out to be somewhat paranoid about his survival and set out to destroy anything he saw as a threat - aka everyone. With help of the power of flight, an insectoid exoskeleton with armor that can withstand blasts from even Galactus, super strength and a guard of 100 aliens by his side it wasn''t so hard. \n Annihilus'' most important tool though and the one which leads to much strife, since he won''t share, is his Cosmic Control Rod. With it he can manipulate cosmic energy to change the molecular structure of matter and project gigantic amounts of destructive energy. \n Annihilus wouldn''t let the Fantastic Four borrow the Rod when Sue Storm had cosmic ray-related pregnancy complications. They just stole it. Annihilus even abducted the Richards'' son Franklin to tap into his powers to further his own. Reed Richards had to shut down his own son''s brain for a while just to protect the Earth''s Solar System.

(95, 95, 'Omega Red', 'It depends on who you ask, but Omega Red, aka Arkady Rossovich, was just your average Russian soldier/serial killer/child rapist. One story says he was captured by Interpol agent and X-Man Banshee. Another tells that his fellow soldiers executed him for his child-related transgressions and he somehow survived. Either way, the KGB gets Rossovich and tries to make a super soldier out of him. Think Captain America but the opposite. \n Scientists had the bright idea of giving Rossovich retractable carbonadium (a more malleable form of adamantium) tentacles instead of his less useful arms. Although quite practical for killing and probably not shaking hands, the carbonadium ended up being poisonous and he had to drain the life out of people just to survive. Besides that great quality which surely makes making new friends a breeze, Omega Red''s body can also produce pheromones called Death Spores, which kill normal humans in seconds. He has superhuman everything normal that you have like strength and speed and reflexes and etc. and his body tissue is also harder than yours. \n One flaw of Omega Red''s is the need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer, which stabilizes his weakness for the alloy. Wolverine, with the help of Sabretooth and Maverick once stole this device, just to make his life a little harder. \n Due to Omega Red''s unpredictability, the Soviet government (who made him) once froze him in cryogenic animation. He''s worked alongside The Hand, Neocommunists, Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin, drug lords like the General and has been the head of the Red Mafia posing as a businessman. He is still looking for the Carbonadium Synthesizer. So if you know of its whereabouts, please contact him.

(96, 96, 'Despero', 'He bathed himself in the Flame of Py''tar and is fueled by an all-consuming hatred for the Justice League. What''s not to love to hate? \n Despero has undergone as many variations as the very group he wishes to inflict fatal injury upon, which accounts somewhat for his lower status on the totem pole. His ambition his high, but one note - kill the Justice League. \n Initially conceived as a weak tyrant, prone to psychologically playing with the fates of his enemies, Despero evolved into more of a physically threatening presence; a thug with delusions of grandeur and with some potent muscle to back it up. His run in Justice League America, leading to a showdown brawl at the United Nations, is a fun read - one has to admire a baddie who decides to wear the UN''s flag as a cape. But ultimately, Despero''s goals are hindered by his one-track approach to achieving them. Consistency is good, but he''ll need more than great physical strength and myopic vision to join the ranks of real DC threats.', 'http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/object/143/14321675/despero_dc_pictureboxart_160w.jpg'),

Mental health experts believe it may have more to do with children seeing sinister portrayals of clowns in the media. If true, Spawn creator Todd McFarlane may have psychologically damaged an entire generation with the Violator. \n A Hell-born demon whose purpose is to groom Hellspawn''s in the service of evil, the gruesome Violator''s most iconic physical form is the Clown, a disgustingly overweight, short, balding man who wears blue face-paint. His demonic powers include super-strength, shape-shifting, healing, teleportation, and the ability to breathe fire... just to name a few. And if being a real bastard was a superpower, we''d have listed that, too. \n Sent to Earth by Malebolgia, the powerful ruler of the Eighth Circle of Hell, Violator is tasked with monitoring Al Simmons. But the foul-mouthed Clown harasses and taunts Simmons, feeling that he is far superior to this newest Spawn. And while he cannot kill any Spawn without an order from his superiors, that hasn''t stopped him from making Simmons life a (literal) living Hell.He has been killed numerous times, only to be sent back to Hell and restored to life by his master. \n Violator first appeared Spawn #1 (May 1992), he was prominently featured in the popular HBO miniseries, and was main antagonist in the oft-maligned 1997 live-action movie (played by John Leguizamo).

The only thing known about his past, though, is that he was a mentalist at carnivals. Carnies are pretty screwed up, right? \n Mastermind''s powers include casting illusions causing people to psionically see, hear and even touch things that don''t really exist. He can make people believe that he is another person or even invisible for that matter. He can even do this to mutants as strong as Professor Xavier and Jean Grey. Being somewhat older with graying hair, he uses these powers to appear younger and better looking. \n Mastermind once helped the Brotherhood take over a whole South American country, by creating the illusion of thousands of soldiers. He was part of the Hellfire Club during the "Dark Phoenix Saga," and is basically the main person responsible for turning Phoenix into Dark Phoenix. He manipulated her into believing she was a Victorian aristocrat, married to Jason Wyngarde, and that she was Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. He then basically killed Cyclops in battle. This pissed her off and got her out of Mastermind''s control. She then turned him catatonic. When he came back to his senses, he manipulated Rogue into leaving her foster mother Mystique while giving Mystique horrible nightmares. He made the X-Men think Cyclops'' fianc Madelyne Pryor was the Dark Phoenix and also compelled Mariko Yashida to reject Wolverine on their wedding day. \n Although Mastermind is dead, his powers live on through his daughters Martinique Jason and Regan Wyngarde who are apparently stronger than he ever was.

So where''s the best place to go to strike fear in the hearts of people if you''re a dragon that''s the size of a house? How about China! Is that Godzilla? No, it''s Fin Fang Foom. \n Some people would argue that hatred is the worst characteristic of the human race, but others swear that it''s laziness or apathy. Fin Fang Foom though, has it all wrapped in one. With the help of a mystical herb, Foom can go into hibernation quicker than he can destroy a small village, which is pretty fast, actually. \n But don''t let his idle exterior fool you; he can be evil too. In one particular story after his body was destroyed, his spirit flew into a statue to reside. Through his power of telepathy, he then willed a small child into bonding with thousands of lizards in a New York sewer to create a new body for him. It''s what fairytales are made out of. \n Besides his powers of telepathy, he is stronger than the average lizard, can fly, regenerate and has access to advanced alien technology. Oh, and he can project an acidic mist from his mouth.
